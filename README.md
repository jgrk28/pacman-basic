To build the game on a mac you can run ./build_game.
On a Windows computer you can follow the instructions in the README
and run "mvn clean install" in both pacman-core/ and pacman-ui-swing/.
Once you build with mvn run the jar at pacman-ui-swing/target/
pacman-ui-swing-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar.

Once the game is running you can press "v" to toggle between versions
and press "space" to start the game. The PacMan and MsPacMan implementations
were preserved from the github repo I found while the "Occupancy Map"
and "Individuals" versions are my own. Once playing you can simply
control the game with the arrow keys. Other commands for debugging and
manipulating the game can be found in the README.
